# Live Telemetry 1.3.1
An Assetto Corsa app to view real time telemetry

## App

The app show on screen real time telemetry of engine, each tire and suspension individually. The goal with this app is not to replace the Assetto Corsa built-in apps with these information, but to help developing better setups more efficiently.

The app uses the mod file directly or the encrypted Kunos files to calculate it's limits, does not need configuration.
